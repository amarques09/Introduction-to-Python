    "\n",
    "The simplest of map projections are cylindrical projections, in which lines of constant latitude and longitude are mapped to horizontal and vertical lines, respectively.\n",
    "This type of mapping represents equatorial regions quite well, but results in extreme distortions near the poles.\n",
    "The spacing of latitude lines varies between different cylindrical projections, leading to different conservation properties, and different distortion near the poles.\n",
    "In the following figure we show an example of the *equidistant cylindrical projection*, which chooses a latitude scaling that preserves distances along meridians.\n",

    "  - ``drawrivers()``: Draw rivers on the map\n",
    "  - ``fillcontinents()``: Fill the continents with a given color; optionally fill lakes with another color\n",

    "  - ``drawcountries()``: Draw country boundaries\n",
    "  - ``drawstates()``: Draw US state boundaries\n",
    "  - ``drawcounties()``: Draw US county boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map features**\n",
    "  - ``drawgreatcircle()``: Draw a great circle between two points\n",
    "  - ``drawparallels()``: Draw lines of constant latitude\n",
    "  - ``drawmeridians()``: Draw lines of constant longitude\n",
    "  - ``drawmapscale()``: Draw a linear scale on the map\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Whole-globe images**\n",
    "  - ``bluemarble()``: Project NASA's blue marble image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``shadedrelief()``: Project a shaded relief image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``etopo()``: Draw an etopo relief image onto the map\n",
    "  - ``warpimage()``: Project a user-provided image onto the map\n",
    "\n",
    "For the boundary-based features, you must set the desired resolution when creating a Basemap image.\n",

    "## Plotting Data on Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most useful piece of the Basemap toolkit is the ability to over-plot a variety of data onto a map background.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to this, there are many map-specific functions available as methods of the ``Basemap`` instance.\n",
    "These work very similarly to their standard Matplotlib counterparts, but have an additional Boolean argument ``latlon``, which if set to ``True`` allows you to pass raw latitudes and longitudes to the method, rather than projected ``(x, y)`` coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these map-specific methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``contour()``/``contourf()`` : Draw contour lines or filled contours\n",
    "- ``imshow()``: Draw an image\n",
    "- ``pcolor()``/``pcolormesh()`` : Draw a pseudocolor plot for irregular/regular meshes\n",
    "- ``plot()``: Draw lines and/or markers.\n",
    "- ``scatter()``: Draw points with markers.\n",
