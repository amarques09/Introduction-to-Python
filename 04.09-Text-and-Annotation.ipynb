    "## Transforms and Text Position\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we have anchored our text annotations to data locations. Sometimes it's preferable to anchor the text to a position on the axes or figure, independent of the data. In Matplotlib, this is done by modifying the *transform*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any graphics display framework needs some scheme for translating between coordinate systems.\n",
    "For example, a data point at $(x, y) = (1, 1)$ needs to somehow be represented at a certain location on the figure, which in turn needs to be represented in pixels on the screen.\n",
    "Mathematically, such coordinate transformations are relatively straightforward, and Matplotlib has a well-developed set of tools that it uses internally to perform them (these tools can be explored in the ``matplotlib.transforms`` submodule).\n",
    "\n",
    "The average user rarely needs to worry about the details of these transforms, but it is helpful knowledge to have when considering the placement of text on a figure. There are three pre-defined transforms that can be useful in this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``ax.transData``: Transform associated with data coordinates\n",
    "- ``ax.transAxes``: Transform associated with the axes (in units of axes dimensions)\n",
    "- ``fig.transFigure``: Transform associated with the figure (in units of figure dimensions)\n",

    "The ``transAxes`` coordinates give the location from the bottom-left corner of the axes (here the white box), as a fraction of the axes size.\n",
    "The ``transFigure`` coordinates are similar, but specify the position from the bottom-left of the figure (here the gray box), as a fraction of the figure size.\n",
